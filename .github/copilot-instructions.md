## Generated Prompt

"Generate a comprehensive copilot-instructions.md file that will guide GitHub Copilot to produce code consistent with our project's standards, architecture, and technology versions. The instructions must be strictly based on actual code patterns in our codebase and avoid making any assumptions. Follow this approach:

### 1. Core Instruction Structure
```markdown
# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Priority Guidelines

When generating code for this repository:

1. **Version Compatibility**: Always detect and respect the exact versions of languages, frameworks, and libraries used in this project
2. **Context Files**: Prioritize patterns and standards defined in the .github/copilot directory
3. **Codebase Patterns**: When context files don't provide specific guidance, scan the codebase for established patterns
4. **Architectural Consistency**: Maintain our ${ARCHITECTURE_STYLE} architectural style and established boundaries
5. **Code Quality**: Prioritize ${CODE_QUALITY_FOCUS == "All" ? "maintainability, performance, security, accessibility, and testability" : CODE_QUALITY_FOCUS} in all generated code

## Technology Version Detection


1. **Language Versions**: Detect the exact versions of programming languages in use
   - Look for language-specific version indicators (e.g., <LangVersion> in .NET projects)
   - Never use language features beyond the detected version

2. **Framework Versions**: Identify the exact versions of all frameworks
   - Check package.json, .csproj, pom.xml, requirements.txt, etc.
   - Respect version constraints when generating code
   - Never suggest features not available in the detected framework versions

3. **Library Versions**: Note the exact versions of key libraries and dependencies
   - Generate code compatible with these specific versions
   - Never use APIs or features not available in the detected versions

## Context Files

Prioritize the following files in .github/copilot directory (if they exist):

- **architecture.md**: System architecture guidelines
- **tech-stack.md**: Technology versions and framework details
- **coding-standards.md**: Code style and formatting standards
- **folder-structure.md**: Project organization guidelines
- **exemplars.md**: Exemplary code patterns to follow

## Codebase Scanning Instructions

When context files don't provide specific guidance:

1. Identify similar files to the one being modified or created
2. Analyze patterns for:
   - Naming conventions
   - Code organization
   - Error handling
   - Logging approaches
   - Documentation style
   - Testing patterns

- Match code organization patterns from similar files
- Apply error handling consistent with existing patterns
- Follow the same approach to testing as seen in the codebase
- Match logging patterns from existing code
- Use the same approach to configuration as seen in the codebase

## Project-Specific Guidance

- Scan the codebase thoroughly before generating any code
- Respect existing architectural boundaries without exception
- Match the style and patterns of surrounding code
- When in doubt, prioritize consistency with existing code over external best practices

### 2. Codebase Analysis Instructions

To create the copilot-instructions.md file, first analyze the codebase to:

1. **Identify Exact Technology Versions**:
   - ${PROJECT_TYPE == "Auto-detect" ? "Detect all programming languages, frameworks, and libraries by scanning file extensions and configuration files" : `Focus on ${PROJECT_TYPE} technologies`}
   - Extract precise version information from project files, package.json, .csproj, etc.
   - Document version constraints and compatibility requirements

2. **Understand Architecture**:
   - Analyze folder structure and module organization
   - Identify clear layer boundaries and component relationships
   - Document communication patterns between components

3. **Document Code Patterns**:
   - Catalog naming conventions for different code elements
   - Note documentation styles and completeness
   - Document error handling patterns
   - Map testing approaches and coverage

4. **Note Quality Standards**:
   - Identify performance optimization techniques actually used
   - Document security practices implemented in the code
   - Note accessibility features present (if applicable)
   - Document code quality patterns evident in the codebase

### 3. Implementation Notes

The final copilot-instructions.md should:
- Be placed in the .github/copilot directory
- Reference only patterns and standards that exist in the codebase
- Include explicit version compatibility requirements
- Avoid prescribing any practices not evident in the code
- Provide concrete examples from the codebase
- Be comprehensive yet concise enough for Copilot to effectively use

Important: Only include guidance based on patterns actually observed in the codebase. Explicitly instruct Copilot to prioritize consistency with existing code over external best practices or newer language features.

## Expected Output

A comprehensive copilot-instructions.md file that will guide GitHub Copilot to produce code that is perfectly compatible with your existing technology versions and follows your established patterns and architecture.
